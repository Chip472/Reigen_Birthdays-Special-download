A fan-made game dedicated to Reigen Arataka.

# Description:
A mysterious customer suddenly called Spirits and Such and only gave their address without ever mentioning a name. Serizawa suggested he and Reigen should do this one last case before getting off work. After they had arrived and reached the second floor of the building, Serizawa got taken away by an unknown entity, which forced Reigen to go up the building all by himself. What will happen? What awaits Reigen at the top of the building? Let's all find out.
